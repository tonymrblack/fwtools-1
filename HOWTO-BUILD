	HOWTO Prepare FWTools Binary Distribution
	=========================================


Requirements
------------

The system is intended to be run on a CentOS / Redhat Enterprise system and
depends on core packages as well as packages from EPEL and Enterprise Linux
GIS efforts.  It has been tested on CentOS 5.2 and 5.3 systems so far. 

The scripts should work fine on i686 (32bit) and x86_64 (64bit) architectures.
Some distinctions are made in the scripts based on which architecture is in 
use.


Get Scripts
-----------

cvs -d :pserver:cvsanon@cvs.maptools.org:/cvs/maptools/cvsroot login
(use empty password)

cvs -d :pserver:cvsanon@cvs.maptools.org:/cvs/maptools/cvsroot fwtools/linuxdist
cd fwtools/linuxdist


Setup EPEL and ELGIS Repositories
---------------------------------

See: http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Enterprise_Linux_GIS

Roughly:

sudo rpm -Uvh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm
sudo rpm -Uvh http://elgis.argeo.org/repos/5/elgis-release-5-5_0.noarch.rpm


Install required packages to build GDAL
---------------------------------------

./setupdev.sh



Fetch and Configure GDAL
------------------------

svn co http://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/branches/1.8/gdal
cd gdal
../gdal_configure.sh
cd ..



Prepare FWTools
---------------

This step is all that should need to be done for each new release.
It will refresh rpms, refresh GDAL from svn and refreshes the GDAL
build. 

edit FW_VERSION as desired.

./full_build.sh


Produces FWTools-linux-x86_64-3.0.6.tar.gz
